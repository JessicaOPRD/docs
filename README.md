## Common Problems

### [Custom grouping components with nesting issues](https://github.com/JessicaOPRD/docs/wiki/Custom-grouping-components-with-nesting-issues)

## Re-usability

### [Using Vuetify Core Functionality](https://github.com/JessicaOPRD/docs/wiki/Using-Vuetify-Core-Functionality)
Getting started with Vuetify's base components, mixins, and factories. Because really, you don't want to re-invent groupable behavior every single time.

# Communicating across the stack

## Axios/ColdFusion REST

### [ColdFusion REST with Axios: Asynchronous Data Passing](https://github.com/JessicaOPRD/docs/wiki/ColdFusion-REST-with-Axios:-Asynchronous-Data-Passing)
I firmly believed the JavaScript ‚û° Server hand-off in a stack is not talked about enough. Especially true when there are documentation issues in the stack itself.

### [Responsive Images](https://github.com/JessicaOPRD/docs/wiki/Responsive-Images) üì∏

Without a CDN, if you want beautiful imagery and good performance, you need to think through serving the correct assets. It's no small task. I've built a couple of dynamic image generators/APIs and I really enjoy this kind of project. They are a bit nerve-wracking.
